# PyBer Analysis


##Overview:

The purpose of the analysis aim to understand the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types, and provide future guidance.

## Results:

We first generated summary table for each city, including the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. 

#### Summary table by city type
||Total Rides|Total Drivers|Total Fares|Average Fare per Ride|Average Fare per Driver|
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |------------- | ------------- |------------- |
|Rural|125|537|$4,327.93|$34.62|$8.06|
|Suburban	|625|8,570|$19,356.33|$30.97|$2.26
|Urban|1,625|	59,602	|$39,854.38|$24.53|$0.67|

#### Total fares by city type

![This is an image](https://github.com/swang202/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/Pyber_fare_summary.png?raw=true)

Based on the analysis ofride-sharing data among the different city types, we discovered that in urban, total fares, rides and drivers are the highest among all city types, while the average fares per ride or per driver are the lowest. This could due to shorter distance traveled or more drivers envolved. On the contrary, total fares, rides and drivers are the lowest in the rural area, while the average fares per ride or per driver are the highest. And the result is consistant among all first four months of 2019.

## Summary:

Base on the analysis, we recommand to invest in more drivers in rural and suburban area, and develop more targeted business models in those area.
